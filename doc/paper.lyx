\begin_layout Title
Subgroup-basis Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of discrete groups
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
We study subgroup-basis Clebsch-Gordan (SBCG) coefficients, which express
 the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of a discrete group in terms of irreducible
 representations of its subgroup.
 With projection matrices, which convert irreducible representations of
 the group to those of its subgroup, SBCG coefficients can be defined in
 a way that is independent of basis of irreducible representations of both
 the group and the subgroup.
 We then impose charge-parity like constraints on these coefficients, which
 restricts the overall phases of SBCG coefficients.
 We provide procedures to find SBCG coefficients and then apply them to
 calculation of the SBCG coefficients of the group 
\begin_inset Formula $\group$
\end_inset

 in the basis of its subgroup 
\begin_inset Formula $\subga$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\subgb$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discrete subgroups of 
\begin_inset Formula $SU\left(3\right)$
\end_inset

 are widely used in flavor models.
 In model building, one needs to study the mathematical properties of the
 selected group.
 An important step here is to find Clebsch-Gordan (CG) coefficients of the
 group, which determines how fields are coupled in the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CG coefficients invoving low-dimensional irreps, especially, three-dimensional
 irreps, play important roles in flavor model buildings.
 These CG coefficients can be calculated in several methods, including but
 not limitted to the Discrete package [ref], which implements the algorithm
 of ref 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "van1978clebsch"

\end_inset

, and the method introduced by Ref 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ludl:2009ft"

\end_inset

.
 However, when comes to CG coefficients involing higher-dimensional irreps,
 these methods are not effective any more.
 These calculations involve complicated algebraic numbers consist of roots
 of unity 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{2k\pi i/n}$
\end_inset

 and their polynomial, and hence it is difficult to obtain simplified results.
 Recently, higher-dimensional irreps are also used in model buildings.
 For example, in ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Chen:2014wiw"

\end_inset

, the sextet and septex representations of the group 
\begin_inset Formula $\group$
\end_inset

 are used in the model building.
 Finding CG coefficients of these higher-dimensional irreps is a challging
 task for these model buildings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another issue is that there are ambiguities in CG coefficients.
 In general, CG coefficients depend on the basis of irreducible representations
 (irrep) of the group.
 There is still a phase ambiguity for a fixed basis.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{X}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{Y}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

 are irreps, one can multiply the CG coefficients for the tensor product
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{X}\otimes\rep{Y}\to\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

 by an arbitrary overall phase.
 In addition, if a tensor product has nontrivial multiplicity, i.e, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{X}\otimes\rep{Y}\to m\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $m>1$
\end_inset

, then the CG coefficients have a 
\begin_inset Formula $U\left(m\right)$
\end_inset

 ambiguity.
 We will give more details about these ambiguities in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Amb_CGC"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We aim to reduce the ambiguities of CG coefficients and find a way to calculate
 the CG coefficients of higer-dimensional irreps of discrete groups.
 We proceed as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We introduce subgroup-basis Clebsch-Gordan (SBCG) coefficients, which are
 CG coefficients of a discrete group that are expressed in terms of irreps
 of its subgroup.
 In the definition of SBCG, basis information is carried in the projection
 matrices, which convert irreps of the group to irreps of its subgroup.
 SBCG coefficients are therefore independent of bases of irreps of both
 the group and its subgroup.
 To reduce the phase ambiguity, we impose additonal constraints on SBCG,
 which requires that contractions of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\rep{X}\otimes\rep{Y}\right)_{\rep{Z}}$
\end_inset

 behave the same as an irrep under charge-parity (CP) like transformations.
 Such constraints restrict the overall phase of SBCG coefficients.
 Particularly, the overall phase of SBCG coefficients for 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{X}\otimes\rep{Y}\to\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

 is fixed if i) 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{X}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{Y}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

 are all real or pseudo-real or ii) 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

 is real or pseudo-real and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{X}$
\end_inset

 is complex conjugate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{Y}$
\end_inset

.
 The multiplicity ambiguities of such cases are reduced from 
\begin_inset Formula $U\left(m\right)$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(m\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We then describe the procedures to calculate SBCG coefficients.
 The crucial step is to solve linear equations with complicated coefficients,
 which can be expressed as polynomials of 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{2\pi i/n}$
\end_inset

.
 These coefficients are elements of cyclotomic fields.
 A Mathematica package is developed to perform arithmetic calculations of
 cyclotomic fields.
 We next demonstrate these procedures by calculating the CG coefficients
 of the group 
\begin_inset Formula $\group$
\end_inset

 in the basis of its subgroups 
\begin_inset Formula $\subga$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\subgb$
\end_inset

.
 For both subgroups, we obtain a complete list of CG coefficients of the
 group 
\begin_inset Formula $\group$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We remark that the similar idea has been applied to continuous groups.
 In ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "deSwart:1963pdg"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $SU\left(3\right)$
\end_inset

 CG coefficients are expressed as linear combinations of products of 
\begin_inset Formula $SU\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

 GG coefficients and isoscalars, where isoscalars play the same role as
 SBCG coefficient in this paper.

Ambiguities of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tensor product of two irreducible representations of a group is in general
 reducible.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 be a discrete group with irreps 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{X}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{Y}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 be vectors of the corresponding Hilbert spaces on which the group elements
 act.
 We use 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{X}\otimes\rep{Y}\to\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

 to indicate that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

 is contained in the decomposition of tensor product 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{X}\otimes\rep{Y}$
\end_inset

.
 Given 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

, there exist a 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 and a set of coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{k\alpha}^{\left(XY\to Z\right)}$
\end_inset

 such that, for all 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in G$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\mr{Z}\left(g\right)Z\right)_{k}=\sum_{l}M_{k\alpha}^{\left(XY\to Z\right)}\left(\mr{X}\left(g\right)X\otimes\mr{Y}\left(g\right)Y\right)_{\alpha},\label{eq:CGC_Def}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mr{Z}$
\end_inset

 is a matrix realization of irrep 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

 and elements of the tensor product 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mr{X}\left(g\right)X\otimes\mr{Y}\left(g\right)Y\right)$
\end_inset

, with dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\dim X\times\dim Y\right)$
\end_inset

, are of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mr{X}\left(g\right)X\right)_{i}\left(\mr{Y}\left(g\right)Y\right)_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 The coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{k\alpha}^{\left(XY\to Z\right)}$
\end_inset

 are called Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.
 For convenience, we will use 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{k\alpha}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 to denote a single CG coefficient and the matrix of CG coefficients respectivel
y.
 Sometimes we will write 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=M^{\left(XY\to Z\right)}\left(X\otimes Y\right)$
\end_inset

, which should be understood the same as the 
\begin_inset Formula $g=e$
\end_inset

 case of eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$

\begin_inset Formula $M^{\left(XY\to Z\right)}$
\end_inset

 satisfy eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda Z$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda M^{\left(XY\to Z\right)}$
\end_inset

 also satisfy the equation.
 So it is then conventional to impose normalization constraints on CG coefficien
ts 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{\alpha}M_{k\alpha}^{*}M_{l\alpha}=\delta_{kl}.\label{eq:CGC_Orthnormal}

 The last ambiguity exists when there are nontrivial multiplicity, i.e.

The tensor product of two identical irreps has symmetric and antisymmetric

 If both parts contain an irrep

\begin_inset Formula $\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

 has multiplicity of 
\begin_inset Formula $2$

 But in practical, we can treat the symmetric

\begin_inset Formula $\rep{Z}$

 as two different irreps when calculating the CG coefficients.

 We choose a basis where elements of

\begin_layout Standard
We have showed that SBCG coefficients are independent of basis of both the
 group and its subgroup.
 There are, however, still ambiguities in SBCG coefficients.
 Consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $U\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

 transformations on irreps and subgroup CG coefficients in the following
 forms
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
P_{X\to a} & \to e^{i\theta_{a}^{\left(X\right)}}P_{X\to a},\label{eq:U1_PXa}\\
\covsub{x_{a}}{y_{b}}{z_{c}} & \to e^{i\phi^{\left(ab\to c\right)}}\covsub{x_{a}}{y_{b}}{z_{c}}.\label{eq:U1_subcg}
\end{align}

\end_inset

Under these 
\begin_inset Formula $U\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

 transformations, the SBCG coefficients transform as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M}_{c,ab}^{\left(XY\to Z\right)}\to e^{i\left(\theta_{a}^{\left(X\right)}+\theta_{b}^{\left(Y\right)}-\theta_{c}^{\left(Z\right)}+\phi^{\left(ab\to c\right)}\right)}\mathcal{M}_{c,ab}^{\left(XY\to Z\right)}.\label{eq:CGSub_M_Transform}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 We see that there are four phase ambiguities for each SBCG coefficient.
 These phase ambiguities stem from the phase ambiguity of irreps and CG
 coefficients.
 In general, they can be removed or reduced by appropriate phase conventions,
 which are usually basis dependent.
 For example, for 
\begin_inset Formula $SU\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

 CG coefficients, it is conventional to choose first CG coefficient be real
 and positive.
 In the following section, we introduce a basis independent convention,
 which can reduce these 
\begin_inset Formula $U\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

 ambiguities and, in some cases, reduce them to sign (
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{2}$
\end_inset

) ambiguities.

Reducing phase ambiguities 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To introduce the phase convention, we first discuss real and complex representat
ions.
 A real (or pseudo-real) representation is a representation whose complex
 conjugate is equivalent to itself.
 While a complex representation is inequivalent to its complex conjugate.
 For convenience, we define a complex conjugate of a real (or pseudo-real)
 representation to be itself.
 Now if 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is a matrix realization of a representation of group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\rho}$
\end_inset

 be the matrix realization of the complex conjugate representation, then
 there exists a unitary matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\cp$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\cp\rho\left(g\right)^{*}\left(\cp\right)^{\dagger}=\bar{\rho}\left(g\right),\quad\forall g\in G.\label{eq:CGSub_Gamma}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

When the representation is complex, we can always choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\rho}\left(g\right)=\rho\left(g\right)^{*}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\cp$
\end_inset

 is simplify the identity matrix.
 When the representation is real, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\rho}$
\end_inset

 should be the same as 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\cp$
\end_inset

 is in general a nontrivial unitary matrix depending on the basis of the
 representation.
 Particularly, for real representation, 
\begin_inset Formula $\cp\cp^{*}=\pm I$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

 is for real representation and 
\begin_inset Formula $-$
\end_inset

 is for pseudo-real representation.
 In the Hilbert space, eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CGSub_Gamma"

\end_inset

 implies 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\cpx{X}X^{*}=\bar{X}.\label{eq:CGSub-GammaX}
\end{equation}

 In the terminology of physics, the matrices

\begin_inset Formula $\cpx{Z}$
\end_inset

 as CP transformation for irrep 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

 The CP constraints imply that the contraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\covlg{X}{Y}{Z}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\covsub{x_{a}}{y_{b}}{z_{c}}$
\end_inset

 should behave the same as 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{c}$
\end_inset

 under complex conjugate operation.
 It is also natural to impose CP constraints on irreps of subgroup embedded
 in irreps of the large group, meaning that 
\begin_inset Formula $\cpx{c}$
\end_inset

 should transform the 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{c}$
\end_inset

 components of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$

\begin_inset Formula $\rep{z_{c}}$

\begin_inset Formula $\rep{x_{a}}$

\begin_inset Formula $\rep{y_{b}}$

\begin_layout Standard
The CP constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CGSub_GammaCon1"

\end_inset

 implies similar constraints for contractions of more than two covariants.
 Consider a contraction of three vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\covlg{X}{\covlg{V}{W}{Y}}{Z}$
\end_inset

 and its counterpart under CP transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\covlg{\bar{X}}{\covlg{\bar{V}}{\bar{W}}{\bar{Y}}}{\bar{Z}}$
\end_inset

.
 The relation between these two is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\cpx{Z}\left(\covlg{X}{\covlg{V}{W}{Y}}{Z}\right)^{*}=\covlg{\bar{X}}{\covlg{\bar{V}}{\bar{W}}{\bar{Y}}}{\bar{Z}}.
\]

\end_inset

 It can be shown as follows:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{lhs} & =\cpx{Z}M^{\left(XY\to Z\right)*}\left(X^{*}\otimes\left(\covlg{V}{W}{Y}\right)^{*}\right)\\
 & =\cpx{Z}M^{\left(XY\to Z\right)*}\left(\cpx{X}^{-1}\otimes\cpx{Y}^{-1}\right)\left(\bar{X}\otimes\left(\covlg{\bar{V}}{\bar{W}}{\bar{Y}}\right)\right)\\
 & =M^{\left(\bar{X}\bar{Y}\to\bar{Z}\right)}\left(\bar{X}\otimes\left(\covlg{\bar{V}}{\bar{W}}{\bar{Y}}\right)\right)\\
 & =\covlg{\bar{X}}{\covlg{\bar{V}}{\bar{W}}{\bar{Y}}}{\bar{Z}}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 where in the third equality we used eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CGSub_CXYZ"

\end_inset

.
 In general we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\cpx{Z}\left(\covlg{X\otimes Y\otimes\cdots}{W}{Z}\right)^{*}=\covlg{\bar{X}\otimes\bar{Y}\otimes\cdots}{\bar{W}}{\bar{Z}},
\]

\end_inset

 where we have suppressed all the nesting structures and intermediate irreps
 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{rhs}$
\end_inset

 is the CP counterpart of 
\begin_inset Formula $\covlg{X\otimes Y\otimes\cdots}{W}{Z}$
\end_inset

 on the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{lhs}$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

 is the trivial singlet representation, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{Z}$
\end_inset

 is the one-dimensional identity matrix and 
\begin_inset Formula $\covlg{\bar{X}\otimes\bar{Y}\otimes\cdots}{\bar{W}}{\bar{Z}}$
\end_inset

 is a c-number complex conjugate to 
\begin_inset Formula $\covlg{X\otimes Y\otimes\cdots}{W}{Z}$
\end_inset

.
 Particularly, if the contraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\covlg{X\otimes Y\otimes\cdots}{W}{1}$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{1}$
\end_inset

 being the trivial singlet, is invariant under CP transformation, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\covlg{X\otimes Y\otimes\cdots}{W}{1}=\covlg{\bar{X}\otimes\bar{Y}\otimes\cdots}{\bar{W}}{1}$
\end_inset

, then the contraction is a real number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above property has an implication in flavor physics models with discrete
 symmetries.
 For a unitary theory, the Lagrangian should be real.
 Therefore, for each term of the Lagrangian, one needs to add its complex
 conjugate to the Lagrangian.
 For example, if a term like 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\covlg{X}{\covlg{V}{W}{\bar{X}}}{1}$
\end_inset

 is contained in the Lagrangian, then a counterpart term 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{*}\covlg{\bar{X}}{\covlg{\bar{V}}{\bar{W}}{X}}{1}$
\end_inset

 is presumably contained in the Lagrangian as well.
 However, for a general CG coefficients, 
\begin_inset Formula $\covlg{X}{\covlg{V}{W}{\bar{X}}}{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\covlg{\bar{X}}{\covlg{\bar{V}}{\bar{W}}{X}}{1}$
\end_inset

 are not necessary complex conjugate to each other.
 To make these two terms complex conjugate, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 in general has to be a complex number with certain phase.
 With the SBCG coefficients defined under the CP constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CGSub_GammaCon1"

\end_inset

, the coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 can always be a real number.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, let us remark on the relative phases among the SBCG coefficients.
 In general, the phase of an individual SBCG coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{c,ab}$
\end_inset

 depends on the overall phase of the subgroup CG coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{\left(x_{a}y_{b}\to z_{c}\right)}$
\end_inset

.
 We see that Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CGSub_Def2"

\end_inset

 is invariant under the following transformation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\covsub{x_{a}}{y_{b}}{z_{c}}\to e^{i\theta}\covsub{x_{a}}{y_{b}}{z_{c}},\quad\mathcal{M}_{c,ab}\to e^{-i\theta}\mathcal{M}_{c,ab}.\label{eq:CGSub_Mcab_phase}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Such a transformation is allowed for all 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\theta<2\pi$
\end_inset

 if any of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{x_{a}}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{y_{b}}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{z_{c}}$
\end_inset

 is complex.
 Therefore, the relative phase among SBCG coefficients are in general not
 fixed.
 But if all of irreps are real or pseudo-real, then 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CGSub_Mcab_phase"

\end_inset

 is allowed only for 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\pi$
\end_inset

, meaning that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{c,ab}$
\end_inset

 is fixed up to a sign factor.
 If the subgroup is an ambivalent group, a group whose irreps are either
 real or pseudo-real, then all the the relative phases among SBCG coefficients
 are fixed up to a sign factor.

Procedures to calculate SBCG coefficients
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we will describe the prcedures to find SBCG coefficients.
 The procedures are straightforward and primarily based on the definition
 of SBCG coefficients, i.e.
 eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CGSub_Def2"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To find the SBCG coefficients, we need to first find CG coefficients of
 the subgroup.
 Here, we assume that the matrix realizations, CP transformations of irreps,
 and CG coefficients of the subgroup 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 are known or easy to find.
 Moreover, the CG coefficients of the subgroup should satisfy the CP constraints
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CGSub_CXYZ"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Step I
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Find matrix realizations of all the irreps of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 in the subgroup basis.
 For simplicity, we choose a basis that projection matrices are in the most
 simple form, meaning that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{X\to j}^{\left(\mathrm{nonzero}\right)}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CG_PXj"

\end_inset

 are identity matrices
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is a special case that the projection matrix cannot be in the trivial
 form.
 This case occurs when two irreps of the group are identified to the same
 irrep of the subgroup.
 For example, for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\group$
\end_inset

 group, both 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{\bar{3}}$
\end_inset

 are identified to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{3_{2}}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{4}$
\end_inset

.
 If we choose 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{3\to3_{2}}$
\end_inset

 to be a identify matrix, then 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\bar{3}\to3_{2}}$
\end_inset

 cannot be identity matrix simultaneously.
 The key point here is to make projection matrices as simple as possible.
\end_layout

\end_inset

One can first find the matrix realization of low-dimensional irreps then
 build the high-dimensional irreps from tensor products.
 Usually the low-dimensional irreps matrix realizations, in a certain basis,
 are already known in the literature or can be obtained from the GAP programming
 platform.
 We therefore focus on finding a similarity transformation that transforms
 the matrices to the desired basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To find the similarity transformation, we need to diagonalize the matrices
 of generators

See Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Entries of these matrices are usually cyclotomic numbers, which are polynomials
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-th roots of unity for certain fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 It is difficult to find the eigenvectors of these matrices directly by
 Mathematica.
 We developed a algorithm to perform arithmetic operation of cyclotomic
 numbers.
 The details are discussed in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Cyclotomic-fields"

\end_inset

.
 With the algorithm, we can find the eigenvector of a matrix for a given
 eigenvalue, which, for low-dimensional irreps, usually can be find directly
 from Mathematica.

\begin_layout Itemize
Step II
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Write down the most general decomposition of a contraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\covlg{X}{Y}{Z}$
\end_inset

 into subgroup contraction as eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CGSub_Def"

\end_inset

 with undetermined SBCG coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{c,ab}$
\end_inset

 and then setup equations for these coefficients.
 With eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CGSub_Def"

\end_inset

, we obtain the expression of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{c,ab}$
\end_inset

 and bilinear forms of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $g=e$
\end_inset

.
 We then substitute the expression of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 into eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CGSub_Def"

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 being generators of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
 By matching of the coefficients of bilinear forms of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

, we obtain homogeneous equations with respect to the unknown variables
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{c,ab}$
\end_inset

.
 In this way, the number of equations we obtained are usually much more
 than the number of unknown variables.
 Many of the equations are dependent to others and hence redundant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, instead of matching coefficients of bilinear forms, we can
 generate the equations by replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 with some constant vectors 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(X,Y\right)=\left(V^{\left(p\right)},W^{\left(p\right)}\right),\quad p=1,2,\cdots\label{eq:Proc_XY}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

There are different choices of the constant vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{\left(p\right)}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W^{\left(p\right)}$
\end_inset

.
 A simple choice is that each vector has only one nonzero component, i.e.,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V_{k}^{\left(p\right)}=\delta_{k,i_{p}},\,W_{k}^{\left(p\right)}=\delta_{k,j_{p}},\label{eq:Proc_VW}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ i_{p}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ j_{p}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are two sets of appropriately chosen positive integers.
 In this way, we can reduce the number of equations.
 Of course, we need to choose enough number of 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{p}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{p}$
\end_inset

 and there could still be redundant equations and some of the equations
 are trivially 
\begin_inset Formula $0=0$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{X}\otimes\rep{Y}\to\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

 has multiplicity 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{Z}$
\end_inset

, then there will be at most 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}-\mu_{Z}$
\end_inset

 independent equations, where 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

 is number of the unknown variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{c,ab}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Step III
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third step is to solve for the unknown variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{c,ab}$
\end_inset

.
 In the solution of the homogeneous linear equations, there will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{Z}$
\end_inset

 free variables and the other 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}-\mu_{Z}$
\end_inset

 variables can be expressed as linear combination of the free variables.
 In principle, we could solve these linear equations using standard methods.
 However, as the coefficients of these linear equations are cyclotomic numbers,
 which come from the matrices of group generators, the exact solutions are
 usually involved unless we find a clever way to simplify the results.
 If we use program like Mathematica to do the work, it usually cannot simplify
 the solution to appropriate forms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways to solve the issue.
 The first way is to use the calculation technique of cyclotomic numbers.
 We can apply Gaussian elimination algorithm with arithmetic operation of
 cyclotomic numbers to solve the equations.
 To be efficient, the Gaussian elimination procedure should only apply to
 a set of independent equations, which can be found by converting the coefficien
ts of equations to float numbers and apply regular Gaussian elimination
 algorithm with certain error tolerance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second way to solve the issue is to use a Mathematica programming trick.
 Instead of solving the equations directly, we convert all the coefficients
 to float numbers and solve the equation numerically.
 We then convert the float numbers back into exact numbers using the Mathematica
 function RootApproximant
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The document of the function can be found on http://reference.wolfram.com/language
/ref/RootApproximant.html.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Because of the numerical instability, the dependency relations of the equations
 are broken when the coefficients are converted to float numbers.
 Hence, it is crucial to pick out the maximal set of independent equations
 before solving the equations.
 Again, this can be done by the Gaussian elimination algorithm with an appropria
te error tolerance.
 The method is informal comparing to the first method.
 But we found it very effective in the calculation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\group$
\end_inset

 CG coefficients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Step IV
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last step is to apply the CP and orthonormalization constraints on the
 SBCG coefficients.
 As discussed in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:CGCs-in-subgroup"

\end_inset

, the CP constraints require that SBCG coefficients of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{X}\otimes\rep{Y}\to\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{\bar{X}}\otimes\rep{\bar{Y}}\to\rep{\bar{Z}}$
\end_inset

 to be complex conjugate of each other.
 When all of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{X}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{Y}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

 are real (or pseudo-real) irreps or when only 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

 is real (or pseudo-real) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{X}=\rep{\bar{Y}}$
\end_inset

 is complex, the overall phases of the SBCG coefficients are fixed.
 The CP constraints of these two cases can be solved as follows.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathcal{M}_{A}\right\} $
\end_inset

 be the sets of free parameters in the solution of setp III, where 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 denotes subscripts of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(c,ab\right)$
\end_inset

, then the CP constraints are translated into linear equations 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L_{1}\left(\left\{ \mathcal{M}_{A}\right\} \right)-L_{2}\left(\left\{ \mathcal{M}_{A}^{*}\right\} \right)=0,\label{eq:Proc_aPcP}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 are linear combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathcal{M}_{A}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathcal{M}_{A}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 respectively.
 These equations can be solve by expressing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{A}$
\end_inset

 in terms of real and imaginary parts, i.e, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{A}=\mathcal{M}_{A}^{\left(r\right)}+i\mathcal{M}_{A}^{\left(i\right)}$
\end_inset

.
 We need apply the orthonormalization constraints to the SBCG coefficients.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{Z}>1$
\end_inset

, we can use the Gram–Schmidt process to build 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{Z}$
\end_inset

 sets of orthonormal CG coefficients.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Above are the procedures of finding SBCG coefficients for a discrete group.
 Let us now count the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) of SBCG coefficients.
 First consider the case I and II, in which overall phases of SBCG coefficients
 are fixed.
 If the multiplicity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{X}\otimes\rep{Y}\to\rep{Z}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{Z}$
\end_inset

, then there will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{Z}$
\end_inset

 free complex coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{c,ab}$
\end_inset

 after solving the homogeneous linear equations.
 The CP constraints generate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{Z}$
\end_inset

 independent equations of the form 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Proc_aPcP"

\end_inset

, which reduce 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{Z}$
\end_inset

 real DOF.
 The normalization condition reduces one more real DOF.
 Therefore, there will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{Z}$
\end_inset

 sets of independent SBCG coeffcients with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{Z}-1$
\end_inset

 real DOF.
 For other cases, in which overall phases of SBCG coefficients are not fixed,
 the homogeneous linear equations and CP contraints lead to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\mu_{Z}$
\end_inset

 sets of SBCG coefficients with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{Z}$
\end_inset

 complex DOF.
 Applying the normalization condition, the 
\begin_inset Formula $2\mu_{Z}$
\end_inset

 sets of SBCG coefficients have 
\begin_inset Formula $2\mu_{Z}-1$
\end_inset

 real DOF.

 The matrix

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{[\rep{3_{2}}]}$
\end_inset

 have the same eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 1,i,-i\right\} $

\end_inset

 Since the eigenvalues are non-degenerate, the matrix

 can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula

Finally, let us consider the

 We can obtain the

\end_inset

 irrep from 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{3}\otimes\rep{6}\to\rep{7}$
\end_inset

.
 However, to determine the norm of the CG coefficients of 
\begin_inset Formula $\covp{3}{6}{7}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\covp{3}{6}{\bar{3}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\covp{3}{6}{8}$
\end_inset

.
 By a straightforward calculation, we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{\rep{\bar{3}}\to\rep{3_{2}}}\covp{3}{6}{\bar{3}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\covs{3_{2}}{1_{0}}{3_{2}}-\frac{i\bar{b}_{7}^{2}}{\sqrt{3}}\covs{3_{2}}{2}{3_{2}}+\frac{i\bar{b}_{7}}{\sqrt{2}}\covs{3_{2}}{3_{1}}{3_{2}},

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\covp{3}{6}{8}=\begin{pmatrix}\covs{3_{2}}{3_{2}}{2}\\
-\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}b_{7}\covs{3_{2}}{2}{3_{1}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\covs{3_{2}}{3_{1}}{3_{1}}\\
\frac{2\bar{b}_{7}}{7}\covs{3_{2}}{1_{0}}{3_{2}}-\frac{\sqrt{2}i}{3}b_{7}\covs{3_{2}}{2}{3_{2}}+\frac{i}{\sqrt{3}}\covs{3_{2}}{3_{1}}{3_{2}}
\end{pmatrix},
\]

\end_inset

 up to overall phases.
 The orthonormalization condition eq.

 determine the SBCG coefficients of 
\begin_inset Formula $\covp{3}{6}{7}$

 to be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\covp{3}{6}{7}=\begin{pmatrix}e^{i\theta_{1}}\covs{3_{2}}{3_{1}}{1_{1}}\\
e^{i\theta_{2}}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\covs{3_{2}}{2}{3_{1}}+\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\bar{b}_{7}\covs{3_{2}}{3_{1}}{3_{1}}\right)\\
e^{i\theta_{3}}\left(\frac{i}{3}\sqrt{\frac{7}{2}}b_{7}\covs{3_{2}}{1_{0}}{3_{2}}-\frac{2i}{3}\bar{b}_{7}^{3}\covs{3_{2}}{2}{3_{2}}-\frac{i}{\sqrt{6}}\covs{3_{2}}{3_{1}}{3_{2}}\right)
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

Applying the CP constraints in analogy to eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, we arrive at 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\left(\theta_{2}-\theta_{1}\right)}=\bar{b}_{7}^{3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\left(\theta_{3}-\theta_{1}\right)}=-i\bar{b}_{7}^{2}$

 Then the generators are

 Unfortunately, since the all of irreps are complex except the trivial singlet,
 the the matrices of

 We can obtain different matrix realizations by performing similarity transforma
tions with diagonal pure phase matrices,

 In the following, we will not set all the

 In this basis, the

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $c=AB$
\end_inset

 is a diagonal matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(AB)^{[\rep{3}]}=\mathrm{diag}\left(\eta,\eta^{2},\eta^{4}\right)\equiv\mathcal{P}^{[3]}.
\]

\end_inset

Consulting the character table of 
\begin_inset Formula $\subgb$
\end_inset

 table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, we see that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{\bar{3}}$
\end_inset

 are the only two multi-dimentional irreps of 
\begin_inset Formula $\subgb$
\end_inset

, and in all singlets irreps, 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is simply one-dimensional identity matrix.
 It then follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $AB$
\end_inset

 are diagonal matrices in all 
\begin_inset Formula $\group$
\end_inset

 irreps 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left(AB\right)^{[\rep{6}]} & =\mathrm{diag}\left(\mathcal{P}^{\left[3\right]},\bar{\mathcal{P}}^{[3]}\right),\\
\left(AB\right)^{[\rep{7}]} & =\mathrm{diag}\left(1,\mathcal{P}^{[3]},\bar{\mathcal{P}}^{[3]}\right),\\
\left(AB\right)^{[\rep{8}]} & =\mathrm{diag}\left(\mathbf{I}_{2},\mathcal{P}^{[3]},\bar{\mathcal{P}}^{[3]}\right),
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{2}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset

 identity matrix and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mathcal{P}}^{[3]}=\left(\mathcal{P}^{[3]}\right)^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

.
 If representation matrices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are given, since 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{2}=e$
\end_inset

, the generator 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is then 
\begin_inset Formula

B^{[\rep{R}]}=A^{[\rep{R}]}\left(AB\right)^{[\rep{R}]},\quad\rep{R}=\rep{3},\,\rep{\bar{3}},\,\rep{6},\,\rep{7},\,\rep{8}.
\]

 We therefore only show the matrices of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 CG coefficients
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the generators, we can now find the SBCG coefficients of 
\begin_inset Formula $\group$
\end_inset

.
 In the following, we will give a few examples to illustrate the details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Example I: 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{6}\otimes\rep{6}\to\rep{6}_{s}^{\left(1\right)}\oplus\rep{6}_{s}^{\left(2\right)}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will find the SBCG coefficients for 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{6}\otimes\rep{6}\to\rep{6}_{s}^{\left(1\right)}\oplus\rep{6}_{s}^{\left(2\right)}$
\end_inset

 as an example to demonstrate the procedures.
 Here the superscription indicates the multiplicity of irreps in the tensor
 product.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first consider the SBCG coefficients in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\subga$
\end_inset

 basis.
 Using the embedding relation 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{6}=\rep{1_{0}}\oplus\rep{2}\oplus\rep{3}$
\end_inset

, we can write down the most general expression of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\covp{6}{6}{6_{s}}$

\begin_inset Formula $S_{4}$

 are SBCG coefficients to be determined.
 In the above equations, the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\covs{x}{y}{z}$
\end_inset

 denotes the 
\begin_inset Formula $\subga$
\end_inset

 group contraction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{x}$

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\rep{y}$
\end_inset

 components of the second 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{6}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{6}\otimes\rep{6}\to\rep{6}_{s}$
\end_inset

 has multiplicity 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, we can setup seven homogeneous linear equations by feeding values into
 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 of eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CGSub_Def2"

\end_inset

.
 To do this, we choose 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 to be the generator 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 to be constant vectors, see eqs.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Proc_XY"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Proc_VW"

\end_inset

.
 It turns out that choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ i_{p}\right\} =\left\{ 1,3\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ j_{p}\right\} =\left\{ 1,4\right\} $
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is enough to generate the equations.
 By solving these equations, we express all coefficients in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{1,11}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{1,22}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{M}_{1,33} & =-\frac{\mathcal{M}_{1,11}}{\sqrt{3}}-\frac{2\mathcal{M}_{1,22}}{\sqrt{3}},\quad\mathcal{M}_{2,12}=\mathcal{M}_{1,22},\\
\mathcal{M}_{2,22} & =-\frac{2\mathcal{M}_{1,11}}{\sqrt{7}}-\frac{3\mathcal{M}_{1,22}}{\sqrt{14}},\\
\mathcal{M}_{2,33} & =\frac{\mathcal{M}_{1,22}}{\sqrt{42}}-\frac{4\mathcal{M}_{1,11}}{\sqrt{21}},\\
\mathcal{M}_{3,13} & =-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\mathcal{M}_{1,11}-\frac{2\mathcal{M}_{1,22}}{3},\\
\mathcal{M}_{3,23} & =\frac{1}{3}\sqrt{\frac{2}{7}}\mathcal{M}_{1,22}-\frac{8\mathcal{M}_{1,11}}{3\sqrt{7}},\\
\mathcal{M}_{3,33} & =\sqrt{\frac{2}{21}}\mathcal{M}_{1,11}+\frac{5\mathcal{M}_{1,22}}{\sqrt{21}}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since all the irreps of 
\begin_inset Formula $\subga$
\end_inset

 are real representations, the CP constraints 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CGSub_ckij"

\end_inset

 are satisfied if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{1,11}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{1,22}$
\end_inset

 are real.
 For the orthonormalization condition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CGSub_orthnormal"

\end_inset

, we consider the SBCG coefficients of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{1_{0}}$
\end_inset

 component.
 We need to find two orthonormal vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathcal{M}_{1,11},\mathcal{M}_{1,22},\mathcal{M}_{1,33}\right\} $
\end_inset

 corresponding to two solutions.
 By the Gram–Schmidt process, we find the solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathcal{M}_{1,11},\mathcal{M}_{1,22}\right)=\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},0\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathcal{M}_{1,11},\mathcal{M}_{1,22}\right)=\left(-\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}},\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\right)$
\end_inset

 can generate such two vectors.
 Substituting the two solutions into 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Ex_SixSix2Six"

\end_inset

, we obtain the SBCG coefficients of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{6}\otimes\rep{6}\to\rep{6}_{s}^{\left(1\right)}\oplus\rep{6}_{s}^{\left(2\right)}$
\end_inset

 shown in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:CGC_S4"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The calculation is similar for 
\begin_inset Formula $\subgb$
\end_inset

 basis.
 According to the decomposition 
\begin_inset Formula $\rep{6}=\rep{3}\oplus\rep{\bar{3}}$
\end_inset

 and tensor products of 
\begin_inset Formula $\subgb$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\covp{6}{6}{6_{s}}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\subgb$
\end_inset

 basis can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\rep{3} & =\mathcal{M}_{3,33}\covt{3}{3}{3}+\mathcal{M}_{3,\bar{3}\bar{3}}\covt{\bar{3}}{\bar{3}}{3_{s}}\\
 & +\frac{\mathcal{M}_{3,3\bar{3}}}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\covt{3}{\bar{3}}{3}+\covt{\bar{3}}{3}{3}\right),\\
\rep{\bar{3}} & =\mathcal{M}_{\bar{3},33}\covt{3}{3}{\bar{3}_{s}}+\mathcal{M}_{\bar{3},\bar{3}\bar{3}}\covt{\bar{3}_{s}}{\bar{3}}{\bar{3}}\\
 & +\frac{\mathcal{M}_{\bar{3},3\bar{3}}}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\covt{3}{\bar{3}}{\bar{3}}+\covt{\bar{3}}{3}{\bar{3}}\right),
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 where the curly brackets denote 
\begin_inset Formula $\subgb$
\end_inset

 contractions.
 The homogeneous linear equations can be generated in the same way as 
\begin_inset Formula $\subga$
\end_inset

 case with input 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ i_{p}\right\} =\left\{ 1,3\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ j_{p}\right\} =\{2,4\}$
\end_inset

 and generator 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Solving the linear equations yields
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{M}_{3,\bar{3}\bar{3}} & =-\sqrt{2}\mathcal{M}_{3,33}-\frac{\mathcal{M}_{3,\bar{3}\bar{3}}}{\sqrt{2}},\quad\mathcal{M}_{\bar{3},33}=-\mathcal{M}_{3,33}-\mathcal{M}_{3,\bar{3}\bar{3}},\\
\mathcal{M}_{\bar{3},\bar{3}\bar{3}} & =\sqrt{2}\mathcal{M}_{3,33},\quad\mathcal{M}_{\bar{3},\bar{3}\bar{3}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\mathcal{M}_{3,\bar{3}\bar{3}}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Now the CP constraints 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CGSub_ckij"

\end_inset

 are nontrivial.
 They can be solved by expressing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{3,33}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{3,\bar{3}\bar{3}}$
\end_inset

 in terms of their real and imaginary parts.
 It turns out that the solution is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{3,\bar{3}\bar{3}}=\mathcal{M}_{3,33}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 The orthonormalization condition then give rise to the SBCG coefficients
 shown in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:CGC_T7"

\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The work can be extended in several directions.
 One direction is to apply the method to other large discrete groups.
 The Hessian group 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma\left(216\phi\right)$
\end_inset

 of order 1080 has a subgroup 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma\left(36\phi\right)$
\end_inset

 of order 108.
 The group 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{5}$
\end_inset

 is a subgroup of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma\left(360\right)$
\end_inset

.
 More details of these groups can be found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ludl:2009ft"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another possible direction is to simplify the procedures to find SBCG coefficien
ts.
 As we have shown, the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{c,ab}$
\end_inset

 are basis independent and fixed up to a possible pure phase.
 It seems not necessary to find matrix realizations of the group and subgroups
 in order to calculate these coefficients.
 A natural guess is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{c,ab}$
\end_inset

 are determined by the coset structure of the group.
 It would be very helpful if there exists a method to determine these coefficien
ts without knowing the matrix realizations and CG coefficients of subgroups.

Cyclotomic field
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

th cyclotomic field contains all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

th roots of unity and the numbers which can be expressed as a polynomials
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

th roots of unity with rational coefficients.
 The general form of an element in the field is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}q_{k}\exp\left(2k\pi i/n\right),\quad q_{k}\in\mathbb{Q}.\label{eq:CN_def}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Discrete group characters are usually expressed in terms of elements of
 such fields.
 In the calculation of this project, we need to perform calculation of these
 fields.
 Here we introduce the algorithm we used in the calculation of these fields.
 we note that the algorithm not only apply to cyclotomic fields but also
 to the numbers which can be written in the same form as eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CN_def"

\end_inset

 with irrational coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{k}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cyclotomic fields are closed in the arithmetic of addition, multiplication,
 and division.
 The addition and multiplication operators are trivially the operators of
 polynomials and we only need to discuss the division.
 If we can find the reciprocal of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CN_def"

\end_inset

, then the problem is solved as the remaining step is simply a multiplication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now consider how to find reciprocal of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CN_def"

\end_inset

.
 For convenience, we now write 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(2\pi i/n\right)$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose the reciprocal of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $g=\sum p_{k}r_{n}^{k}$
\end_inset

, then expanding 
\begin_inset Formula $fg$
\end_inset

 and collecting 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}^{k}$
\end_inset

 terms, we have 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
begin{subequations}
\backslash
label{eq:CN_equations}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
0 & =\sum_{i}q_{\left[k\right]-i}p_{i},\quad k>0,\,\left[k\right]=k,\,n+k,\\
1 & =q_{0}p_{0}+\sum_{i}q_{n-i}p_{i}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
end{subequations}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We therefore setup 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 linear equations for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 unknown variables 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Naively, we should be able to solve the equations.
 However, the equations are usually not independent and sometimes there
 is no solution.
 The root cause is that the expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CN_def"

\end_inset

 is not unique.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the ambiguities comes from that 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}^{k}$
\end_inset

 are not independent, e.g,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}r_{n}^{k}=0.
\]

\end_inset

We therefore can always eliminate 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}^{n-1}$
\end_inset

 from the expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CN_def"

\end_inset

.
 Is it the only dependent relation? The answer is no.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 has a factor 
\begin_inset Formula $1<p<n$
\end_inset

, then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n/p}r_{n}^{kp}=0
\]

\end_inset

is also a dependent relation.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 has 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 positive factors (not including 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 itself), we can setup 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 equations and solve for
