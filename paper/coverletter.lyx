\begin_layout Standard
Dear Editor,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We would like to request a re-submittion of the manuscript xxx to the Journal
 of Mathematical Physics.
 The previous version of the manuscript does not state clearly what are
 the new results of the work.
 We apologize for the confusion to you and the associated editor.
 In order to increase the overall clarity of the paper, We have made revisions
 to the original document and prepared it for a re-submission.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We completely rewrote the abstract and introduction.
 The title of the manuscript is changed to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of discrete groups in subgroup bases
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We now refer to the factors we introduced as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

embedding factors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Here, we would like to highlight what is new in the work: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We factor the CG coefficients of a discrete group into those of its subgroup
 and factors we call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

embedding factor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 A general study of this idea on discrete group has not been done in the
 literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We provide a definition of embedding factors and show that it is independent
 of basis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We analyze the phase ambiguity of the embedding factor and find way to reduce
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We also provides some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

concrete
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 results: We apply our technique to the group 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{PSL}_{2}\left(7\right)$
\end_inset

, a group has application in particle physics.
 We find the representation matrices of the group in which their subgroups
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{4}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{7}$
\end_inset

 are block diagonal matrices.
 A complete list of CG coefficients of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{PSL}_{2}\left(7\right)$
\end_inset

 in terms of embedding factors of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{4}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{7}$
\end_inset

 are obtained.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We hope that these changes will result in a more readable manuscript, and
 would welcome any further suggestions from the referee.
